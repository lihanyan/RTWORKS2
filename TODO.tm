The first experience of programming in ubuntu is hard. Accustomed to windows system and VS2013, I'm uncomfortable to write in gedit. But I'll overcome it.
The first version is simple and the result continues to loop because I add the wrong time variable 't'.
Next step, I'll change endless loop and export some trajectory informations.

second push--simple_motion:
now the programme can run rightly. And because I set the chabu period "T=10", which is too big,the accuracy of trajectory is not good.
but this will lessen loop times. To improve the accuracy, you can decrease "T".
