The first experience of programming in ubuntu is hard. Accustomed to windows system and VS2013, I'm uncomfortable to write in gedit. But I'll overcome it.
The first version is simple and the result continues to loop because I add the time variable--'t'.
Next step, I'll change endless loop and export some trajectory informations.
